# Note Manager

## Note Manager
This repository was created to allow the users to create and manage their notes, and allows them to view and delete them when needed.

This project contain a few files that allows this web app to run and create and manage notes, this web app is based on nodeJS & nodeJS libraries that allow this web app to run and make it possible to run and get deployed live on Heroku web server.

This project is mainly focused on showing up my skills in JS and HTML with the integration of NodeJS libraries and improve on it as I progress my journey of learning full stack. 

The web app will store the note on db.json file that allow the user to retrieve and manage when required and then it display the notes on front end that is based on HTML.
